[TOC]

I would like to have short summary here about these terms:

- Database â€“ System which keep data to stack business tasks
- Warehouse â€“ System which designed to provide data for analytics systems
- Data lake â€“ Storage for all data. Everything will be stored here. for future generations ðŸ™‚

# Database

Stored your data to organize current business activity.

Technologies: MySQL, PostgreSQL, etcâ€¦ Any relation or non relation databases.

# Warehouse

![Warehouse](images/60dcbc825daf4d570b422319_data-warehousing.png){: .image-process-article-image}

Special tipe of database. Can be organizer in similar technologies as Database layer.

It is historical storage which should answer on the business questions:

- how owtenâ€¦
- how manyâ€¦
- etcâ€¦

Technologies to analyze data: Amazon Redshift, Azure Synapse, PowerBI

A bit about terms

- DW or DWH â€“ data warehouse
- EDW â€“ enterprise data warehouse

# Data lake

You donâ€™t know what you want, just keep data, maybe you will be able to analyze it in future and get some benefits from it. Nice approach, I like it ðŸ™‚

Technologies which we can use:

in AWS: Amazon S3, AWS Lake Formation

in Azure: Azure blob storage, Azure Data Lake

on Premise: Apache Hadoop, Ceph, PostgreSQL cluster, maybe MinIO, whatever what you can image. but be careful it is incredibly hard.

Here, I would like to describe basic concepts or elements that exist in PostgreSQL and are its main parts.

[Book to read: PostgreSQL 14 –∏–∑–Ω—É—Ç—Ä–∏, –ï–≥–æ—Ä –†–æ–≥–æ–≤](https://edu.postgrespro.ru/postgresql_internals-14.pdf)

# MVCC

MVCC - Multiversion Concurrency Control

The main idea - read locks don't affects other read or write locks. Two different transactions can lock the same data and read and write this data at the same time.

With MVCC we can avoid table or row loks and increase performance.

# Transaction isolation

In PostgreSQL we can use

- `READ COMMITTED`
- `REPEATABLE READ` (without phantom reading)
- `SERIALIZABLE`

Note: `READ UNCOMMITED` can be used but works in PostgreSQL like `READ COMMITTED`

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
-- or
BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
```
default isolation level : `READ COMMITTED`

# TOAST

TOAST - the Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique

Page size in PostgreSQL equals 8 kB and one tuple can't be splitted into more than one page. To store large tuples it's data will be compressed or splitted into pages using a mechanism named TOAST.

TOAST - it's a separate table with sliced column values from the original table.

### problems

TOAST adds performance penalty for TEXT, JSONB data structures.

It means, it is _bad idea_ to use data from json (jsonb) fields directly in OLTP mode.

# VACUUM

VACUUM reclaims storage occupied by dead tuples.

'dead tuples' means tuples that were marked as unavailable during the deletion or update process and that not in transaction scope.

```sql
VACUUM my_table;
```

`autovacuum` - the process that clears the table

# WAL

WAL - Write Ahead Log

This is a fast storage for changes (in cached pages in RAM) which will be saved to disk before the transaction is approved.

The main idea - we can avoid data loss with pages which are cached in memory and still not saved to disk.

# Data file

Table data (and some other) in PostgreSQL are splitted in 8 kB pages and stored in format:

![PostgreSQL data file format](/images/pg_data_file_format.png){: .image-process-big-article-image}

- When we need to read one tuple or one value, we must read whole page.
- When we need to read value for one single column, we must read all data from all columns.
